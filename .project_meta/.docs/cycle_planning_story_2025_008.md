3. **Network Configuration Persistence**: State management across system restarts
4. **Permission Requirements**: Administrative privilege handling

## Sequential Thinking Analysis

### Technical Approach Analysis

**Problem Breakdown:**
1. **Interface Discovery**: Enumerate available network interfaces safely
2. **MAC Address Management**: Generate, validate, and apply new MAC addresses
3. **State Persistence**: Maintain original values for rollback capability
4. **System Integration**: Interface with macOS network configuration
5. **Error Recovery**: Handle failures gracefully with automatic rollback

**Technology Stack Decisions:**
- **Core Language**: Swift (leveraging existing codebase)
- **System Interface**: Foundation Process APIs for system commands
- **Network Layer**: System Configuration Framework where possible
- **CLI Integration**: ArgumentParser extensions following established patterns
- **GUI Integration**: SwiftUI integration using established bridges

**Architecture Approach:**
Based on proven patterns from our catalog, we'll implement:
1. **Facade Pattern** (PATTERN-2025-039): MacAddressSpoofingManager as system coordinator
2. **System Command Execution** (PATTERN-2025-040): Safe subprocess management
3. **CLI Extension** (PATTERN-2025-041): Modular command structure
4. **Rollback Management**: Transactional approach with persistent state

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Identified Risks:**
1. **System Permission Requirements**
   - *Risk Level*: Medium
   - *Impact*: Could block functionality for non-admin users
   - *Mitigation*: Clear permission requirement documentation and graceful degradation

2. **Network Connectivity Disruption**
   - *Risk Level*: High
   - *Impact*: Could temporarily disconnect network interfaces
   - *Mitigation*: Automatic rollback on failure, connection verification

3. **MAC Address Validation Complexity**
   - *Risk Level*: Low
   - *Impact*: Invalid addresses could cause network issues
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive validation before application

4. **System Compatibility**
   - *Risk Level*: Medium
   - *Impact*: Different macOS versions may have varying interface management
   - *Mitigation*: Version detection and adaptive command strategies

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive testing in isolated network environments
- Automatic rollback mechanisms for all operations
- User permission verification before attempting modifications
- Network connectivity monitoring during operations

## Pattern Consultation and Application

### Applicable Patterns from Catalog

**PATTERN-2025-039: Identity Spoofing Manager Pattern (Mandatory)**
- **Application**: MacAddressSpoofingManager as primary facade
- **Benefits**: Simplified interface, coordinated subsystem management
- **Implementation**: Single entry point for all MAC spoofing operations

**PATTERN-2025-040: Syscall Hook Integration Pattern (Mandatory)**
- **Application**: System command execution for network interface management
- **Benefits**: Safe Swift-C interoperability, robust error handling
- **Implementation**: SystemCommandExecutor integration for ifconfig/networksetup

**PATTERN-2025-041: CLI Extension Pattern (Mandatory)**
- **Application**: MAC spoofing command additions to PrivacyCtl

**Additional Applicable Patterns:**
- **Repository Pattern**: MacAddressRepository for state persistence
- **Command Pattern**: Network interface operation encapsulation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different spoofing strategies (random, custom, etc.)

### New Pattern Opportunities

**Potential Pattern Candidates:**
1. **Network Interface Management Pattern**: System-level interface enumeration and management
2. **Transactional Network Configuration Pattern**: Atomic network configuration changes with rollback
3. **Hardware Validation Pattern**: MAC address and network interface validation

## Implementation Approach and Architecture

### Core Components Design

**1. MacAddressSpoofingManager.swift**
```swift
// Facade pattern implementation
class MacAddressSpoofingManager {
    private let interfaceManager: NetworkInterfaceManager
    private let repository: MacAddressRepository
    private let systemExecutor: SystemCommandExecutor
    private let rollbackManager: RollbackManager
    
    func spoofMacAddress(interface: String, newMac: String?) async throws -> Bool
    func restoreOriginalMac(interface: String) async throws -> Bool
    func listAvailableInterfaces() async throws -> [NetworkInterface]
}
```

**2. NetworkInterfaceManager.swift**
```swift
// System-level interface management
class NetworkInterfaceManager {
    func enumerateInterfaces() async throws -> [NetworkInterface]
    func getCurrentMacAddress(interface: String) async throws -> String
    func setMacAddress(interface: String, mac: String) async throws -> Bool
    func validateInterface(name: String) async throws -> Bool
}
```

**3. MacAddressRepository.swift**
```swift
// Persistent state management
class MacAddressRepository {
    func storeOriginalMac(interface: String, mac: String) async throws
    func getOriginalMac(interface: String) async throws -> String?
    func clearStoredMac(interface: String) async throws
    func getAllStoredMacs() async throws -> [String: String]
