# STORY-2025-008: MAC Address Spoofing Implementation

## Story Overview
**Priority**: High  
**Business Value**: Critical  
**Technical Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Estimated Effort**: 16-20 hours  
**Phase**: 2 (MAC Address Spoofing)

## Business Context
Implement MAC address spoofing functionality to provide network-level privacy protection for users. This builds on Phase 1's identity spoofing foundation and extends privacy controls to the network interface layer.

## Goals & Objectives
- Enable users to safely modify MAC addresses of network interfaces
- Provide rollback mechanisms to restore original MAC addresses
- Integrate with existing CLI and GUI frameworks
- Maintain system stability and network connectivity
- Establish comprehensive testing and security validation

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **MacAddressSpoofingManager.swift**
   - Network interface enumeration and validation
   - MAC address generation and validation
   - Safe MAC address modification operations
   - Automatic rollback on failure scenarios

2. **NetworkInterfaceManager.swift**
   - Wrapper for ifconfig/networksetup system commands
   - Interface status monitoring and validation
   - Permission requirement handling
   - Network connectivity preservation

3. **MacAddressRepository.swift**
   - Persistent storage of original MAC addresses
   - State management for spoofing operations
   - Recovery mechanisms for system restarts
   - Data integrity validation

### Integration Points
- **CLI Integration**: Extend PrivacyCtl with MAC spoofing commands
- **GUI Integration**: Add MAC spoofing views to PrivarionGUI
- **Command System**: Leverage existing SystemCommandExecutor
- **Error Handling**: Integrate with PrivarionError framework
- **Logging**: Extend Logger for MAC spoofing operations
