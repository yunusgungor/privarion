## Problem Statement

Traditional DNS filtering operates globally without considering the context of which application is making the request. This approach lacks granularity for privacy-focused use cases where different applications should have different network access policies. Users need the ability to block tracking domains for some applications while allowing them for others, or to monitor specific application network behavior without blocking.

## Context and Applicability

**When to use this pattern:**
- Building privacy-focused network filtering systems
- Need application-specific network policies
- Require granular control over application network access
- Building parental control or enterprise network security systems
- Need to monitor application network behavior while preserving functionality

**When NOT to use this pattern:**
- Simple domain blocking requirements without application context
- High-performance scenarios where application identification overhead is critical
- Systems without reliable application identification capabilities
- Networks where all applications should have identical policies

**Technology Stack Compatibility:**
- macOS (using process identification APIs)
- Linux (using netfilter/iptables integration)
- Windows (using WinDivert or similar)
- Any platform with process/application identification capabilities

## Solution Structure

```swift
// Core filtering logic with application context
internal func dnsProxy(_ proxy: DNSProxyServer, shouldBlockDomain domain: String, for applicationId: String?) -> Bool {
    // Global domain blocking check (highest priority)
    if isDomainBlocked(domain) {
        Logger.shared.info("Blocking globally blocked domain: \\(domain)")
        return true
    }
    
    // Application-specific rule evaluation
    if let appId = applicationId,
       let rule = getApplicationRule(for: appId) {
        
        switch rule.ruleType {
        case .blocklist:
            let shouldBlock = rule.blockedDomains.contains { blockedDomain in
                domain.hasSuffix(blockedDomain)
            }
            if shouldBlock {
                Logger.shared.info("Blocking domain \\(domain) for app \\(appId) due to blocklist rule")
            }
            return shouldBlock
            
        case .allowlist:
            let isAllowed = rule.allowedDomains.contains { allowedDomain in
                domain.hasSuffix(allowedDomain)
            }
            if !isAllowed {
                Logger.shared.info("Blocking domain \\(domain) for app \\(appId) - not in allowlist")
            }
            return !isAllowed
            
        case .monitor:
            // Monitor only, don't block but log for analysis
            Logger.shared.info("Monitoring domain access: \\(domain) for app \\(appId)")
            recordDomainAccess(domain: domain, applicationId: appId, blocked: false)
            return false
        }
    }
    
    // Default behavior: allow if no specific rules apply
    return false
}

// Application rule definition
public struct ApplicationRule {
    public enum RuleType {
        case blocklist    // Block specified domains
        case allowlist    // Only allow specified domains
        case monitor      // Monitor but don't block
    }
    
    public let applicationId: String
    public let ruleType: RuleType
    public let blockedDomains: [String]
    public let allowedDomains: [String]
    public let description: String
}
```

**Pattern Components:**
1. **Global Policy Layer:** Universal domain blocking that applies to all applications
2. **Application Identification:** System for reliably identifying requesting applications
3. **Policy Resolution Engine:** Logic for determining appropriate policy based on application context
4. **Rule Type System:** Flexible rule types (blocklist, allowlist, monitor) for different use cases
5. **Logging and Monitoring:** Comprehensive activity tracking for compliance and analysis

## Implementation Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- Reliable application identification mechanism
- DNS interception capability (proxy server or system-level hooks)
- Configuration management system for storing rules
- Logging framework for activity tracking

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Application Identification Setup:**
```swift
// Platform-specific application identification
#if os(macOS)
private func getApplicationId(from connection: NWConnection) -> String? {
    // Use process identification APIs to determine requesting application
    // Implementation depends on platform-specific APIs
    return processIdentifier.getApplicationBundle(for: connection)
}
#elseif os(Linux)
private func getApplicationId(from connection: NWConnection) -> String? {
    // Use /proc filesystem or netlink sockets
    return linuxProcessIdentifier.getProcessInfo(for: connection)
}
#endif
```

2. **Rule Definition and Storage:**
```swift
// Rule configuration structure
public struct ApplicationNetworkConfig {
    public var globalBlockedDomains: [String] = []
    public var applicationRules: [String: ApplicationRule] = [:]
    
    public mutating func addApplicationRule(_ rule: ApplicationRule) {
        applicationRules[rule.applicationId] = rule
    }
}

// Rule persistence
extension ConfigurationManager {
    func getApplicationNetworkConfig() -> ApplicationNetworkConfig {
        return getCurrentConfiguration().modules.applicationNetwork
    }
    
    func updateApplicationRule(_ rule: ApplicationRule) throws {
        var config = getCurrentConfiguration()
        config.modules.applicationNetwork.addApplicationRule(rule)
        try updateConfiguration(config)
    }
}
```

3. **Policy Engine Implementation:**
```swift
private func evaluatePolicy(domain: String, applicationId: String?) -> FilteringDecision {
    let decision = FilteringDecision()
    
    // Apply global policies first
    if isGloballyBlocked(domain) {
        decision.action = .block
        decision.reason = "Global blocklist"
        return decision
    }
    
    // Apply application-specific policies
    if let appId = applicationId,
       let rule = getApplicationRule(for: appId) {
        return evaluateApplicationRule(rule, domain: domain)
    }
    
    // Default policy
    decision.action = .allow
    decision.reason = "No applicable rules"
    return decision
}

struct FilteringDecision {
    enum Action {
        case allow
        case block
        case monitor
    }
    
    var action: Action = .allow
    var reason: String = ""
    var shouldLog: Bool = true
}
```

### Configuration Requirements
