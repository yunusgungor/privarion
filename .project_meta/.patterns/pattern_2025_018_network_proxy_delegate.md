## Problem Statement

When implementing network proxies that require custom filtering or processing logic, developers face the challenge of separating low-level network operations from business logic while maintaining high performance and testability. Monolithic approaches tightly couple network mechanics with filtering logic, making testing difficult and reducing reusability.

## Context and Applicability

**When to use this pattern:**
- Building network proxies (DNS, HTTP, TCP/UDP) with custom filtering requirements
- Need to separate protocol handling from business logic processing
- Require independent testing of network operations and filtering logic
- Want reusable network components across different filtering scenarios
- Building high-performance network services with pluggable processing

**When NOT to use this pattern:**
- Simple network clients without complex filtering requirements
- Single-purpose proxies where separation adds unnecessary complexity
- Real-time systems where delegate calls introduce unacceptable latency
- Memory-constrained environments where delegate overhead is significant

**Technology Stack Compatibility:**
- SwiftNIO-based network applications
- UDP/TCP proxy implementations
- iOS/macOS network services
- Cross-platform Swift network applications

## Solution Structure

```swift
// Core proxy protocol that handles network I/O
protocol DNSProxyServerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func shouldFilter(domain: String) -> Bool
    func processQuery(_ query: DNSQuery) -> DNSResponse?
}

// Network proxy implementation focused on I/O
class DNSProxyServer {
    weak var delegate: DNSProxyServerDelegate?
    private let upstreamServer: String
    private let port: Int
    
    func start() throws {
        // Network setup and binding logic
    }
    
    private func handleQuery(_ query: DNSQuery) -> DNSResponse {
        // Delegate filtering decision
        if delegate?.shouldFilter(domain: query.domain) == true {
            return createBlockedResponse(for: query)
        }
        
        // Delegate custom processing
        if let customResponse = delegate?.processQuery(query) {
            return customResponse
        }
        
        // Default upstream forwarding
        return forwardToUpstream(query)
    }
}

// Business logic implementation
class NetworkFilteringManager: DNSProxyServerDelegate {
    private let blockedDomains: Set<String>
    
    func shouldFilter(domain: String) -> Bool {
        return blockedDomains.contains(domain)
    }
    
    func processQuery(_ query: DNSQuery) -> DNSResponse? {
        // Custom filtering logic
        return nil // Delegate to default handling
    }
}
```

**Pattern Components:**
1. **Proxy Component**: Handles low-level network operations (binding, packet processing, upstream communication)
2. **Delegate Protocol**: Defines interface for filtering and processing decisions
3. **Business Logic Component**: Implements filtering rules and custom processing logic
4. **Configuration Component**: Manages proxy settings and filtering rules

## Implementation Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- SwiftNIO framework dependency
- Understanding of delegate pattern principles
- Network programming knowledge (UDP/TCP)
- Protocol-specific knowledge (DNS, HTTP, etc.)

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Preparation Phase:**
   - Define delegate protocol with clear responsibility separation
   - Identify which operations require business logic decisions
   - Design error handling strategy for delegate failures
   - Plan performance requirements and constraints

2. **Core Implementation:**
   - Implement network proxy focused solely on I/O operations
   - Use weak delegate references to prevent retain cycles
   - Provide sensible defaults when delegate is unavailable
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for network operations

3. **Validation and Testing:**
   - Create mock delegate implementations for testing
   - Test proxy functionality independently of business logic
   - Validate performance characteristics under load
   - Test error conditions and delegate failure scenarios

### Configuration Requirements
```swift
struct ProxyConfiguration {
    let listenPort: Int
    let upstreamServer: String
    let upstreamPort: Int
    let timeout: TimeInterval
    let bufferSize: Int
    
    // Delegate-specific configuration
    let enableCustomProcessing: Bool
    let fallbackBehavior: FallbackBehavior
}

enum FallbackBehavior {
    case allowAll
    case blockAll
    case forwardUpstream
}
```

## Benefits and Trade-offs

### Benefits
- **Performance:** Clean separation allows optimization of network and business logic independently
- **Maintainability:** Clear responsibilities make code easier to understand and modify
- **Scalability:** Delegate can be swapped or enhanced without changing proxy implementation
- **Security:** Business logic isolation reduces attack surface of network components
- **Development Speed:** Independent testing of components accelerates development

### Trade-offs and Costs
- **Complexity:** Additional abstraction layer requires more design consideration
- **Performance Overhead:** Delegate calls introduce minimal but measurable overhead
- **Learning Curve:** Developers need to understand delegate pattern and separation principles
- **Maintenance Cost:** Multiple components require coordinated maintenance and versioning

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: DNS Filtering Proxy
**Context:** Block malicious domains while allowing legitimate traffic
```swift
class DNSFilteringProxy: DNSProxyServerDelegate {
    private let malwareDomains: Set<String>
    private let monitoring: NetworkMonitoringEngine
    
    func shouldFilter(domain: String) -> Bool {
        let shouldBlock = malwareDomains.contains(domain)
        monitoring.recordQuery(domain: domain, blocked: shouldBlock)
        return shouldBlock
    }
    
    func processQuery(_ query: DNSQuery) -> DNSResponse? {
        // Log all queries for analysis
        monitoring.logQuery(query)
        return nil // Use default handling
    }
}
```
**Outcome:** Clean separation allows independent testing of filtering logic and monitoring

### Example 2: HTTP Proxy with Content Filtering
**Context:** Filter HTTP requests based on content policies
```swift
class HTTPContentFilter: HTTPProxyDelegate {
    private let contentPolicies: [ContentPolicy]
    
    func shouldFilter(request: HTTPRequest) -> Bool {
        return contentPolicies.contains { policy in
            policy.matches(request)
        }
    }
    
    func processRequest(_ request: HTTPRequest) -> HTTPResponse? {
        // Apply content transformation if needed
        return nil
    }
}
```
**Outcome:** Flexible content filtering without coupling to HTTP protocol handling

### Example 3: Performance Monitoring Proxy
**Context:** Collect performance metrics for network operations
```swift
class PerformanceMonitoringDelegate: ProxyDelegate {
    private let metrics: MetricsCollector
    
    func shouldFilter(request: NetworkRequest) -> Bool {
        let startTime = Date()
        defer { 
            metrics.recordProcessingTime(Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime))
        }
        
        // Perform filtering logic
        return performFiltering(request)
    }
}
```
**Outcome:** Performance monitoring integrated without modifying core proxy logic

## Integration with Other Patterns

### Compatible Patterns
- **Configuration-Driven Module Architecture (PATTERN-2025-019):** Delegate can be configured through centralized configuration
- **Manager-Coordinator Pattern (PATTERN-2025-020):** Manager can coordinate multiple proxy instances with different delegates
- **Real-time Monitoring Pattern (PATTERN-2025-022):** Delegate can integrate monitoring without affecting proxy performance

### Pattern Conflicts
- **Monolithic Service Pattern:** Directly conflicts with separation principles
- **Synchronous Processing Pattern:** May conflict if delegate operations are expensive

### Pattern Composition
```swift
// Combining with Manager-Coordinator pattern
class NetworkFilteringManager {
    private let dnsProxy: DNSProxyServer
    private let httpProxy: HTTPProxyServer
    
    init() {
        dnsProxy = DNSProxyServer()
        dnsProxy.delegate = self // Manager acts as delegate
        
        httpProxy = HTTPProxyServer()
        httpProxy.delegate = self
    }
}
```

## Anti-patterns and Common Mistakes

### What NOT to Do
1. **Heavy Delegate Operations:** 
   - Don't perform expensive operations in delegate methods
