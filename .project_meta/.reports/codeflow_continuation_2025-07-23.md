## 🎯 Next Story: STORY-2025-018

### **Title:** TCC Permission Authorization Engine & Dynamic Security Policies
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 16 hours  
**Complexity Score:** 7.5/10

### **Key Innovation:**
Integration of Spring Security authorization patterns with macOS TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permission system, creating a unified permission policy engine.

### **Core Deliverables:**
1. **TCCPermissionEngine.swift** - TCC database access and permission enumeration
2. **PermissionPolicyEngine.swift** - Policy-driven permission authorization with SecurityPolicyEngine integration  
3. **TemporaryPermissionManager.swift** - Time-limited permission grants with automatic expiration
4. **CLI Extensions** - Permission management commands
5. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Mock TCC scenarios and integration tests

### **Technical Highlights:**
- **Actor-Based Architecture**: Leveraging Swift concurrency for thread-safe permission management
- **Policy Integration**: Unified security policy evaluation combining SecurityPolicyEngine patterns
- **Performance Target**: <50ms TCC.db enumeration, 99.9% temporary permission cleanup reliability
- **Spring Security Patterns**: Resource-based authorization, scope validation, policy-driven decisions
