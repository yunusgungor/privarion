          switch self {
          case let .profileNotFound(profile, available):
              return """
              üí° Available profiles:
              \(available.map { "   ‚Ä¢ \($0)" }.joined(separator: "\n"))
              
              üí° To create a new profile:
                 privarion profile create \(profile) "Profile description"
              """
