**Learning Extraction Date:** 2025-07-23  
**Quality Score:** 9.2/10  
**Pattern Confidence:** High  

## New Patterns Identified

### PATTERN-2025-081: Test Mode Configuration Pattern
**Category:** Testing  
**Maturity Level:** 6  
**Description:** Configuration-driven test mode that simulates system dependencies for reliable CI/CD testing

**Implementation:**
```swift
public struct Configuration {
    public let isTestMode: Bool
    
    // In implementation:
    if configuration.isTestMode {
        // Simulate operations
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 10_000_000)
        logger.debug("Test mode: Simulating operation")
        return
    }
    // Real system operations
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates system dependencies in tests
- Maintains realistic timing characteristics  
- Enables reliable CI/CD pipelines
- Preserves production code paths

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Use for operations requiring system privileges
- Maintain similar timing patterns in test mode
- Preserve error handling paths
- Document test mode behavior clearly

### PATTERN-2025-082: Actor-based Resource Registry Pattern
**Category:** Concurrency  
**Maturity Level:** 8  
**Description:** Thread-safe resource management using Swift actors for concurrent access control

**Implementation:**
```swift
private actor ResourceRegistry {
    private var activeResources: [UUID: Resource] = [:]
    private let maxResources: Int
    
    func registerResource(_ resource: Resource) throws {
        guard activeResources.count < maxResources else {
            throw ResourceError.maxResourcesExceeded(maxResources)
        }
        activeResources[resource.id] = resource
    }
    
    func getResource(_ id: UUID) -> Resource? {
        return activeResources[id]
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates data races in resource management
- Provides clean async/await interface
- Enables quota enforcement
- Maintains strong type safety

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Use for managing shared mutable state
- Configure limits through dependency injection
- Provide async methods for all operations
- Include cleanup and monitoring methods

### PATTERN-2025-083: APFS Integration Pattern
**Category:** System Integration  
**Maturity Level:** 7  
**Description:** Native macOS APFS file system operations with proper error handling and performance monitoring

**Implementation:**
```swift
private func createAPFSSnapshot(name: String) async throws {
    let startTime = DispatchTime.now()
    
    let process = Process()
    process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/usr/bin/tmutil")
    process.arguments = ["localsnapshot"]
    
    // Execute and monitor performance
    try process.run()
    process.waitUntilExit()
    
    let duration = DispatchTime.now().uptimeNanoseconds - startTime.uptimeNanoseconds
    let durationMs = Double(duration) / 1_000_000
    
    if durationMs > performanceTarget {
        logger.warning("Operation exceeded target: \\(durationMs)ms")
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Leverages native macOS capabilities
- Provides zero-trace execution
- Includes performance monitoring
- Handles privilege requirements

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Always include performance monitoring
- Provide test mode alternatives
- Handle privilege escalation gracefully
- Include comprehensive error handling

### PATTERN-2025-084: Security Extension Pattern
**Category:** Security  
**Maturity Level:** 8  
**Description:** Clean extension of existing security systems with domain-specific events

**Implementation:**
```swift
extension SecurityMonitoringEngine {
    public enum DomainEvent: Sendable {
        case resourceCreated(UUID, Double)
        case resourceDestroyed(UUID, Double)
        case suspiciousActivity(UUID, String)
    }
    
    public func reportDomainEvent(_ event: DomainEvent) async {
        let securityEvent = convertToSecurityEvent(event)
        reportSecurityEvent(securityEvent)
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Maintains security system cohesion
- Provides domain-specific event types
- Enables centralized security monitoring
- Preserves existing security workflows

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Define domain-specific event enums
- Convert to core SecurityEvent types
- Maintain async reporting patterns
- Include confidence and evidence data

### PATTERN-2025-085: Performance-First Implementation Pattern
**Category:** Performance  
**Maturity Level:** 7  
**Description:** Development approach driven by explicit performance targets with continuous monitoring

**Implementation:**
```swift
public struct PerformanceTargets {
    public let operationTimeoutMs: Double
    public let warningThresholdMs: Double
}

private func performOperation() async throws {
    let startTime = DispatchTime.now()
    
    // Execute operation
    try await actualOperation()
    
    // Monitor and validate performance
    let duration = calculateDuration(from: startTime)
    
    if duration > targets.warningThresholdMs {
        logger.warning("Performance target exceeded: \\(duration)ms > \\(targets.warningThresholdMs)ms")
    }
    
    if duration > targets.operationTimeoutMs {
        throw PerformanceError.operationTimeout(duration, targets.operationTimeoutMs)
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures performance requirements are met
- Provides early warning of regressions
- Enables performance-driven development
- Creates performance-aware culture

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Define explicit performance targets
- Monitor all critical operations
- Include warnings and hard limits
- Log performance metrics consistently
