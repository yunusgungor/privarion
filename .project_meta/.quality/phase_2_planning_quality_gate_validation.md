- âœ… Sequential Thinking completeness score: 10/10 (thorough decision analysis)

### Implementation Architecture Validation

#### âœ… Core Components Designed
1. **MacAddressSpoofingManager.swift** - Interface enumeration, MAC validation, spoofing operations
2. **NetworkInterfaceManager.swift** - System command wrappers, status monitoring
3. **MacAddressRepository.swift** - State persistence, recovery mechanisms

#### âœ… Integration Points Defined
- **CLI Integration**: Extension to PrivacyCtl with new commands
- **GUI Integration**: New views for MAC spoofing management
- **Command System**: Leverages existing SystemCommandExecutor
- **Error Handling**: Integrates with PrivarionError framework

#### âœ… Implementation Phases Planned
- **Phase 2a**: Core Infrastructure (6-8 hours)
- **Phase 2b**: Data Persistence (4-5 hours)
- **Phase 2c**: GUI Integration (4-5 hours)
- **Phase 2d**: Testing & Validation (2-3 hours)

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

#### âœ… High-Impact Risks Identified & Mitigated
1. **Network Connectivity Loss**
   - Mitigation: Pre-operation validation + automatic rollback
2. **Sudo Permission Denial**
   - Mitigation: Clear user communication + graceful degradation

#### âœ… Medium-Impact Risks Identified & Mitigated
1. **Invalid MAC Generation**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive validation + multiple attempts
2. **State Corruption**
   - Mitigation: Atomic operations + integrity checks

### Quality Gates Defined

#### âœ… Code Quality Requirements
- Code coverage â‰¥95% for all core components
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Integration tests for real-world scenarios
- Security audit compliance

#### âœ… Performance Standards
- Interface enumeration <1 second
- MAC address modification <2 seconds
- Network connectivity preservation
- Resource usage within limits

#### âœ… Security Validation
