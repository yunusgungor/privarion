# macOS Development Expert

Comprehensive guidance for macOS app development. This skill aggregates specialized modules for different aspects of macOS development.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks about macOS development best practices
- Wants code review for macOS/Swift projects
- Needs help with SwiftUI, SwiftData, or AppKit
- Is implementing macOS 26 (Tahoe) features
- Wants UI/UX review against HIG
- Needs architecture guidance for macOS apps

## Available Modules

Read relevant module files based on the user's needs:

### coding-best-practices/
Swift 6+ code quality and modern idioms.
- `swift-language.md` - Modern Swift patterns
- `modern-concurrency.md` - async/await, actors, Sendable

## How to Use

1. Identify user's need from their question
2. Read relevant module files from subdirectories
3. Apply the guidance to their specific context
4. Reference Apple documentation when needed

## Example Workflow

**User asks about SwiftData performance:**
1. Read `swiftdata-architecture/performance.md`
2. Read `swiftdata-architecture/query-patterns.md` if relevant
3. Apply recommendations to their code
