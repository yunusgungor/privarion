## Learning Integration & Patterns Discovered

### 1. Actor-Based Architecture Pattern
**Discovery:** Swift actors provide excellent thread safety for security-critical operations
**Application:** Used throughout temporary permission system
**Benefits:** Zero data races, clean async/await integration
**Reusability:** Pattern applicable to all concurrent security operations

### 2. Layered Permission Architecture
**Discovery:** Separation of TCC engine, policy engine, and temporary management
**Application:** Three-layer architecture with clear responsibilities
**Benefits:** High testability, clear separation of concerns
**Reusability:** Template for future permission-related features

### 3. CLI Integration Best Practices
**Discovery:** ArgumentParser + Async actors require careful availability management
**Application:** Comprehensive `@available` annotations and public API design
**Benefits:** Clean CLI UX with full async support
**Reusability:** Pattern for all future CLI integrations

### 4. Performance-First Development
**Discovery:** Early performance targets drive architectural decisions
**Application:** <50ms targets achieved <3ms actual performance
**Benefits:** Excellent user experience, system responsiveness
**Reusability:** Performance-first approach for all future features
