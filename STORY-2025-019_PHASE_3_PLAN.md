### 3. Batch Operations 🔄
**Goal**: Efficient bulk permission management

#### Batch Actions
- Select multiple permissions for bulk operations
- Bulk revoke operations with confirmation
- Bulk duration extension
- Bulk export of selected permissions
- Batch deletion of expired permissions

#### Selection UI
- Select all/none toggles
- Individual selection checkboxes
- Selection counter and summary
- Bulk action toolbar

### 4. Settings and Preferences ⚙️
**Goal**: Customizable user experience

#### User Preferences
- Default permission duration settings
- Auto-refresh intervals
- Notification preferences
- Theme and appearance settings
- Export format preferences

#### Application Settings
- Permission cleanup policies
- Security settings
- Audit logging configuration
- Integration settings

### 5. Real-time Monitoring 📊
**Goal**: Live permission status tracking

#### Monitoring Features
- Real-time permission status updates
- Expiry countdown timers
- Automatic refresh on system events
- Permission usage tracking
- Alert notifications for expiring permissions

## Technical Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Export/Import System
```swift
// Export Manager
actor PermissionExportManager {
    func exportToJSON(permissions: [TemporaryPermissionGrant]) async throws -> Data
    func exportToCSV(permissions: [TemporaryPermissionGrant]) async throws -> Data
    func importFromJSON(data: Data) async throws -> [TemporaryPermissionTemplate]
}

// File handling UI
struct ExportImportView: View {
    @State private var showingExportOptions = false
    @State private var showingImportPicker = false
    // Implementation with SwiftUI file handling
}
```

### 3.2 Search and Filter System
```swift
// Search manager
@Observable
class PermissionSearchManager {
    var searchText: String = ""
    var activeFilters: Set<PermissionFilter> = []
    var filteredPermissions: [TemporaryPermissionGrant] = []
    
    func performSearch()
    func addFilter(_ filter: PermissionFilter)
    func clearFilters()
}

// Filter UI components
struct PermissionFilterBar: View
struct SearchResultsView: View
```

### 3.3 Batch Operations
```swift
// Selection state management
@Observable
class PermissionSelectionManager {
    var selectedPermissions: Set<String> = []
    var isSelectionMode: Bool = false
    
    func toggleSelection(for id: String)
    func selectAll()
    func clearSelection()
}

// Batch action UI
struct BatchActionToolbar: View
struct BulkOperationSheet: View
```

- [ ] File picker integration

### Phase 3.2: Search and Filtering (25 minutes)
- [ ] Create PermissionSearchManager
- [ ] Implement search algorithm
- [ ] Add search bar to UI
- [ ] Create filter options UI
- [ ] Implement filter logic
- [ ] Search result highlighting

### Phase 3.3: Batch Operations (20 minutes)
- [ ] Create PermissionSelectionManager

- [ ] Implement batch action toolbar
- [ ] Add bulk revoke functionality
- [ ] Bulk operation confirmation dialogs

### Phase 3.4: Settings Integration (15 minutes)

- [ ] Final build verification

## Acceptance Criteria

### Export/Import
- ✅ Users can export active permissions to JSON/CSV
- ✅ Users can import permission templates
- ✅ File operations have proper error handling
- ✅ Export includes all relevant permission data

### Search/Filter
- ✅ Real-time search across all permission fields
- ✅ Multiple filter combinations work correctly
- ✅ Search results are highlighted and relevant
- ✅ Filter state persists during session

### Batch Operations
- ✅ Users can select multiple permissions
- ✅ Bulk actions work reliably
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental actions
- ✅ Selection state is managed correctly

### Settings

- ✅ Error handling is comprehensive

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **File I/O Complexity**: SwiftUI file handling can be complex
  - *Mitigation*: Use DocumentPicker and proven patterns
- **Search Performance**: Large permission lists may impact performance  
  - *Mitigation*: Implement efficient filtering algorithms
- **State Management**: Complex selection state across multiple views
  - *Mitigation*: Centralized state management with @Observable

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature Scope**: Ambitious feature set for remaining time
  - *Mitigation*: Prioritize core functionality, defer polish if needed
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple new systems to integrate
  - *Mitigation*: Incremental integration and testing

## Success Metrics
- All acceptance criteria met
- Clean build with no errors/warnings
- Responsive UI performance
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly interface design

## Post-Phase 3 Planning
After Phase 3 completion:
- Final integration testing
- Documentation updates
- Story completion summary
- Next story planning preparation

**Estimated Total Time**: 100 minutes
**Current Progress**: Phase 3 Ready
**Quality Gate**: TBD upon completion
