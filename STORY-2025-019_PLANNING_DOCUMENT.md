# STORY-2025-019 PLANNING DOCUMENT
## "Temporary Permission GUI Integration with SwiftUI"

**Planning Date:** 23 Temmuz 2025  
**Story Type:** Feature Enhancement  
**Dependency:** STORY-2025-018 (Completed)  
**Methodology:** Codeflow System v3.0

---

## Story Overview

### Context
Following the successful completion of STORY-2025-018 (TCC Permission Authorization Engine & Dynamic Security Policies), we now have:
- ✅ Complete temporary permission system with CLI
- ✅ Actor-based TemporaryPermissionManager with <3ms performance
- ✅ 7 comprehensive CLI commands
- ✅ Robust public API with proper availability annotations

### Objective
Integrate the temporary permission management system into the existing PrivarionGUI SwiftUI application, providing users with a comprehensive graphical interface to manage temporary permissions alongside the existing CLI tools.

### Value Proposition
- **User Experience:** Native macOS GUI for temporary permission management
- **Accessibility:** Visual interface for users who prefer GUI over CLI
- **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing Privarion GUI features
- **Consistency:** Unified experience across CLI and GUI interfaces

## Architecture Research & Context7 Integration

### Clean Architecture for SwiftUI Patterns
Based on Context7 research from `/nalexn/clean-architecture-swiftui`:

**Presentation Layer (SwiftUI Views):**
- Stateless views that function as pure UI representations
- No business logic embedded in views
- State injected via @Environment from AppState
- Side effects forwarded to Interactors

**Business Logic Layer (Interactors):**
- TemporaryPermissionInteractor to interface with TemporaryPermissionManager
- Forward results to AppState or Bindings (not direct returns)
- Handle all temporary permission business logic

**Data Access Layer (Repositories):**
- TemporaryPermissionRepository as async interface
- Bridge between Interactors and TemporaryPermissionManager actor
- Provide Publisher-based API for reactive updates

### Swift Composable Architecture Patterns
Based on Context7 research from `/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture`:

**State Management:**
- @Shared state for temporary permissions across features
- @ObservableState for local view state
- Dependency injection via @Dependency wrapper

**Architecture Benefits:**
- Predictable state updates with reducer pattern
- Built-in testing capabilities with TestStore
- Excellent async/await integration with actors
- Strong type safety and compile-time error detection

### Recommended Approach: Clean Architecture + TCA Hybrid

**Rationale:**
1. **Existing Codebase:** PrivarionGUI already uses SwiftUI patterns
2. **Actor Integration:** TemporaryPermissionManager is an actor (requires careful UI integration)
3. **Performance:** Need reactive UI updates for temporary permissions
4. **Testing:** Must maintain high test coverage standards

---

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **UI Responsiveness:** <16ms for all UI operations (60fps)
- **Permission Operations:** Maintain <3ms for underlying operations
- **Memory Efficiency:** <5MB additional memory footprint
- **Reactive Updates:** <100ms latency for permission state changes

### Architecture Integration Points

#### 1. State Management
```swift
// Temporary Permission State in AppState
@ObservableState
struct TemporaryPermissionState {
    @Shared(.inMemory("active-permissions")) var activeGrants: [TemporaryPermissionGrant] = []
    var isLoading: Bool = false
    var error: String? = nil
    var selectedGrant: TemporaryPermissionGrant? = nil
}
```

#### 2. Interactor Pattern
```swift
protocol TemporaryPermissionInteractor {
    func loadActivePermissions() async
    func grantPermission(_ request: GrantRequest) async -> GrantResult
    func revokePermission(grantID: String) async -> Bool
    func observePermissionChanges() -> AnyPublisher<[TemporaryPermissionGrant], Never>
}
```

#### 3. View Architecture
```swift
// Main Temporary Permissions View
struct TemporaryPermissionsView: View
// Permission Detail View
struct PermissionDetailView: View  
// Grant Permission Sheet
struct GrantPermissionSheet: View
// Permission List Row
struct PermissionRowView: View
```

### Integration with Existing GUI

#### Navigation Integration
- Add "Temporary Permissions" tab to main navigation
- Integrate with existing NavigationManager
- Maintain consistency with other feature tabs

#### Design System Integration
- Use existing PrivarionGUI design tokens
- Maintain consistent typography and spacing
- Follow established interaction patterns

#### Error Handling Integration
- Integrate with existing ErrorManager
- Use established error presentation patterns
- Maintain user experience consistency

## Phase Planning

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Week 1)
**Deliverables:**
- TemporaryPermissionInteractor implementation
- Basic TemporaryPermissionsView with list functionality
- Integration with existing AppState
- Navigation tab addition

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can view active temporary permissions in GUI
- Permission list updates automatically when permissions expire
- Navigation integration works seamlessly
- Performance maintains <16ms UI responsiveness

### Phase 2: Permission Management (Week 2)
**Deliverables:**
- GrantPermissionSheet for creating new temporary permissions
- Permission detail view with revoke functionality
- Error handling and loading states
- Form validation and user feedback

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can grant new temporary permissions via GUI
- Users can revoke existing permissions with confirmation
- Form validation prevents invalid permission requests
- Error states are clearly communicated to users

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
**Deliverables:**
- Export functionality (JSON/CSV)
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Batch operations (revoke multiple)
- Settings and preferences integration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can export permission data from GUI
- Search/filter functionality performs well with 100+ permissions
- Batch operations maintain data consistency
- Settings integrate with existing preferences system
