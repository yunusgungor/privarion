# Swift Foundation - System Programming Documentation

## Overview
This document contains Swift Foundation framework documentation focused on system programming, networking, and subprocess management capabilities relevant to the Privarion privacy protection system.

## Key Areas Covered

### 1. Subprocess Management
- **Asynchronous Process Execution**: Using `run()` methods with `CollectedResult` for simple command execution
- **Process Control**: Managing process lifecycle with signals, termination, and platform-specific options
- **Input/Output Handling**: Various input/output protocols including streaming and buffering
- **Environment Configuration**: Setting environment variables and execution context

### 2. Platform-Specific Features

#### Darwin (macOS)
- **PlatformOptions**: Quality of service, user/group IDs, process groups, sessions
- **Signal Handling**: Unix signal management (interrupt, terminate, kill, etc.)
- **Process Configuration**: Using `posix_spawn()` with custom attributes

#### Linux
- **Extended Configuration**: User/group ID management, supplementary groups, session creation
- **File Descriptor Management**: Controlling file descriptor inheritance
- **Process Security**: Privilege management and sandboxing capabilities

### 3. System Integration Patterns

#### Process Execution
```swift
// Basic subprocess execution
let result = try await run(.name("command"), arguments: ["arg1", "arg2"])

// With custom environment and working directory
let result = try await run(
    .name("command"),
    environment: .custom(["KEY": "value"]),
    workingDirectory: FilePath("/path/to/dir")
)
```

#### Signal Management
```swift
// Send signals to processes
try execution.send(signal: .terminate, toProcessGroup: false)
try execution.send(signal: .kill, toProcessGroup: true)
```

#### Input/Output Streaming
```swift
// Stream processing
let result = try await run(.name("command")) { execution in
    for try await chunk in execution.standardOutput {
        let data = String(chunk.bytes, as: UTF8.self)
        // Process data in real-time
    }
}
```

### 4. Security and Monitoring

#### Process Isolation
- User and group ID management
- Supplementary group configuration
- Session creation and detachment
- File descriptor control

#### Resource Management
- Memory and CPU limits
- File descriptor limits
- Process group management
- Quality of service settings

### 5. Error Handling
- **SubprocessError**: Comprehensive error handling with platform-specific underlying errors
- **Signal Handling**: Proper signal management and process cleanup
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of system resources

## Relevance to Privarion

### Network Filtering Module (STORY-2025-011)
- **Process Control**: Managing network-related system processes
- **Environment Management**: Setting up isolated execution environments
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown and restart of network services

### Sandbox and Syscall Monitoring (STORY-2025-012)
- **Process Isolation**: User/group ID management for sandboxed processes
- **Resource Control**: Limiting and monitoring system resource usage
- **Security Enforcement**: Privilege management and access control

### System Integration
- **CLI Tools**: Managing system-level privacy protection tools
- **Service Management**: Starting/stopping system services
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Platform Compatibility**: Ensure proper handling of Darwin vs Linux differences
2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for system operations
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management
4. **Security**: Follow principle of least privilege for system operations
5. **Performance**: Minimize overhead for system-level operations

## Next Steps

1. Implement subprocess management utilities using Swift Foundation patterns
2. Create platform-specific configuration managers
3. Develop signal handling for graceful service management
4. Implement secure process isolation mechanisms
5. Create comprehensive error handling and logging systems
